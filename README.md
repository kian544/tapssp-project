# tapssp-project

My project is going to be tackling a terminal based rougelike videogame. 
The main goal will be to have map generation, turned based combat/dialogue, and more, like using AI plugins for randomization.

The core of the game will be based on things like trait based APIs, a lightweight architecture, and even benchmarks and logs for either optimization, or player data

There will be a lot of options of crates for me to choose from, certain ones that come to mind at first will be rand for RNG, rusqlite for logs, and serde for saving and loading game data. 

To run the game, first clone this repo to your local machine, then enter the terminal on the "Sunny Days" Folder, and use the cmd:
cargo clean - To clean out any previous runs
cargo run - To begin running the game

Once in the game, simply click Q, or q, to quit the game, you may move around by using the WASD/Key Arrows
